file_write "test.txt" "Hello World"

# This gets parsed as object literal {file_read: "test.txt"}
set content file_read "test.txt"
print "Type of content:" content

# But this works correctly
set content2 (file_read "test.txt")
print "Content2:" content2

# And this works too
print "Direct:" file_read "test.txt"
