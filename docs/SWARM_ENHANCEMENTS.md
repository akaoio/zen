# Swarm System Enhancements Summary

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. Multi-Swarm System Awareness
- Created `multi-swarm-awareness.md` component emphasizing 32 agents across 4 swarms
- All agents now understand they're part of a larger multi-swarm ecosystem
- Frequent `make vision` checks (every 5-10 minutes) are mandatory

### 2. Enhanced Task Management with task.js
- Created `task.js` utility for streamlined task management
- Replaced manual YAML creation with simple commands
- Activity tracking throughout task lifecycle
- Task creation is MANDATORY for ALL agents before any work

### 3. Continuous Work Until 100% Complete
- Created `persistence-engine.md` component for never-stop protocol
- Agents work in infinite loops until project is 100% complete
- Automatic task discovery from `make vision` output
- Built-in handling for blockages and alternative work

### 4. MANIFEST.json Access Control
- Created `manifest-access-control.md` component
- Only Architects can modify MANIFEST.json
- Queens and Workers have read-only access
- Clear escalation path for manifest issues

### 5. Enhanced Component Integration
Updated `assemble-dna.js` to include:
- `multi-swarm-awareness` for all agent types
- `persistence-engine` for continuous work
- `manifest-access-control` for proper permissions

## Key Rules Enforced

1. **Task Creation is MANDATORY** - No exceptions, even for queens
2. **Frequent Vision Checks** - Every 5-10 minutes minimum
3. **File Ownership Respect** - Never work on files marked with [other-agent-id]
4. **Continuous Work** - Keep working until 100% complete
5. **Manifest Integrity** - Only architects modify MANIFEST.json

## Usage

To create enhanced swarms:
```bash
./swarm.sh create-swarm swarm-1 --workers lexer,parser,types,runtime,stdlib,memory
./swarm.sh create-swarm swarm-2 --workers lexer,parser,types,runtime,stdlib,memory
./swarm.sh create-swarm swarm-3 --workers lexer,parser,types,runtime,stdlib,memory
./swarm.sh create-swarm swarm-4 --workers lexer,parser,types,runtime,stdlib,memory
```

To run with tmux:
```bash
./tmux.sh
# Then in each pane:
# Pane 1: swarm-1 work
# Pane 2: swarm-2 work
# Pane 3: swarm-3 work
# Pane 4: swarm-4 work
```

## Multi-Swarm Benefits

1. **4x Throughput** - 32 agents working in parallel
2. **Conflict Prevention** - File ownership tracking via make vision
3. **Continuous Progress** - Agents never stop until 100% complete
4. **Quality Control** - Only architects can change contracts
5. **Full Visibility** - All agents see all tasks via task.js

The system is now a true multi-swarm persistent implementation engine that will work continuously until the ZEN language is 100% complete with all tests passing.
