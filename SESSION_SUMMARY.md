# ZEN Interpreter Fix Session Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Method Calls Without Arguments
**Problem**: Standalone method calls like `t.method1` were not executing - they were returning the method function instead.

**Solution**: Modified `visitor_visit_compound` to detect when a property access returns a function and is used as a standalone statement, then automatically execute it with the implicit self parameter.

### 2. Memory Corruption with Multiple Methods
**Problem**: When a class had multiple methods, the second method's AST node would have corrupted memory (garbage function name).

**Root Cause**: The `self_ast` created for method execution was being freed after the function call, but the function scope was still referencing it.

**Solution**: Commented out the `ast_free(self_ast)` call after method execution to prevent freeing memory that's still in use.

### 3. Second Method Not Executing
**Problem**: In classes with multiple methods, only the first method would execute correctly. The second method would show corrupted data.

**Solution**: Fixed by addressing the memory corruption issue above.

## Current Working Features

✅ Class definitions with multiple methods
✅ Method calls with zero arguments (e.g., `t.method1`)
✅ Method calls with arguments (e.g., `t.greet "World"`)
✅ Property access in expressions (e.g., `print p.name`)
✅ Class constructors with arguments
✅ Methods returning values
✅ Implicit self parameter in methods

## Known Limitations

❌ Property assignment syntax not implemented (`set obj.prop value`)
❌ Method calls on self within methods don't execute (e.g., `self.method2` returns function instead of calling it)
❌ No support for setting properties on self within methods

## Test Results

### Working Examples:
```zen
# Multiple methods
class Test
    function method1
        print "Method 1"
    
    function method2
        print "Method 2"

set t new Test
t.method1  # Prints: Method 1
t.method2  # Prints: Method 2

# Methods with arguments
class Test
    function greet name
        print "Hello, " + name

set t new Test
t.greet "World"  # Prints: Hello, World

# Property access
set p { name "Alice" }
print p.name  # Prints: Alice
```

### Not Working:
```zen
# Property assignment
set obj {}
set obj.name "Alice"  # Parser doesn't support this syntax

# Self method calls
class Test
    function a
        return "A"
    
    function b
        return self.a  # Returns function instead of calling it
```

## Technical Details

The fix involved modifying the visitor to detect when:
1. A statement in a compound is a property access
2. That property access returns a function (method)
3. The property access is used as a standalone statement

When these conditions are met, the visitor automatically executes the method with the object as the implicit self parameter.

The memory corruption fix was subtle - the AST node for self was being freed while still referenced by the function's scope, causing the second method lookup to fail.
