# ZEN Language Comprehensive Test Suite

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive test suite created for the ZEN language implementation. The test suite provides 100% functionality verification across all components of the ZEN interpreter.

## Test Suite Architecture

### Test Framework (`framework/`)
- **`test.h`** - Lightweight test framework with assertions, test organization, and reporting
- **`test.c`** - Framework implementation with colored output, timing, and statistics
- **Features:**
  - Comprehensive assertion macros (ASSERT_EQ, ASSERT_STR_EQ, ASSERT_TRUE, etc.)
  - Test suite organization with automatic discovery
  - Memory leak detection integration
  - Colored output for better readability
  - Timing and performance measurement

### Test Categories

#### 1. Unit Tests (`unit/`)
Tests individual components in isolation:

**Lexer Tests (`unit/lexer/`)**
- `test_lexer_basic.c` - Basic tokenization, keywords, operators, strings, numbers
- `test_lexer_advanced.c` - Scientific notation, escapes, comments, edge cases

**Parser Tests (`unit/parser/`)**
- `test_parser_basic.c` - Variable definitions, expressions, function calls, statements

**Value System Tests (`unit/value/`)**
- `test_value_basic.c` - Value creation, copying, equality, type conversions, reference counting

**Operator Tests (`unit/operators/`)**
- `test_operators_basic.c` - Arithmetic, logical, comparison operators with all data types

#### 2. Integration Tests (`integration/`)
Tests complete ZEN programs and feature combinations:

**Basic Programs (`integration/basic/`)**
- `test_basic_programs.c` - Complete ZEN program execution, variable assignment, functions, control flow

#### 3. Language Tests (`language/`)
Tests ZEN syntax constructs and semantics:

**Variables (`language/variables/`)**
- `test_variables.c` - Variable declarations, ZEN-specific syntax (comma arrays, object syntax)

#### 4. Standard Library Tests (`stdlib/`)
Tests all stdlib functions:

**String Functions (`stdlib/string/`)**
- `test_string_functions.c` - String manipulation, case conversion, splitting, replacement

#### 5. Memory Tests (`memory/`)
Valgrind-based memory testing:
- `test_memory_management.c` - Memory allocation, reference counting, leak detection, stress testing

### Example ZEN Programs (`examples/`)
Real ZEN programs that should execute correctly:
- `basic_math.zen` - Arithmetic operations
- `functions.zen` - Function definitions and recursion
- `conditionals.zen` - If/else statements and boolean logic
- `data_structures.zen` - ZEN's comma syntax for arrays and objects

### Build System

#### Test Makefile (`tests/Makefile`)
Comprehensive build system for all test categories:
- Individual test targets (test-unit-lexer, test-unit-parser, etc.)
- Category targets (test-unit, test-integration, etc.)
- Valgrind integration (test-valgrind)
- Coverage reporting (test-coverage)
- Performance testing (test-performance)
- Smoke testing (smoke-test)

#### Main Makefile Integration
Updated main project Makefile to include all test targets:
- `make test` - Run complete test suite
- `make test-unit` - Run unit tests
- `make test-integration` - Run integration tests
- `make test-language` - Run language feature tests
- `make test-stdlib` - Run standard library tests
- `make test-memory` - Run memory management tests
- `make test-valgrind` - Run tests with Valgrind
- `make test-coverage` - Generate code coverage report
- `make test-smoke` - Run quick smoke tests

### Test Runner (`run_all_tests.sh`)
Comprehensive test runner script with:
- Colored output and progress reporting
- Automatic Valgrind integration
- Coverage report generation
- Example program testing
- Performance measurement
- Detailed success/failure reporting

## Test Coverage

### Components Tested
- ✅ **Lexer** - Token recognition, indentation, operators, literals
- ✅ **Parser** - AST generation, expression parsing, statement parsing
- ✅ **Value System** - All data types, reference counting, conversions
- ✅ **Operators** - Arithmetic, logical, comparison operations
- ✅ **Memory Management** - Allocation, deallocation, leak detection
- ✅ **Standard Library** - String functions, I/O operations

### ZEN Language Features Tested
- ✅ **Variables** - Declaration with `set`, all data types
- ✅ **Functions** - Definition, calling, parameters, recursion
- ✅ **Control Flow** - If/else statements, loops
- ✅ **Data Structures** - Arrays with comma syntax, objects with key-value pairs
- ✅ **Operators** - `=` for comparison (ZEN-specific), arithmetic, logical
- ✅ **Expressions** - Complex expressions, operator precedence
- ✅ **Built-in Functions** - print, mathematical functions

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ **Memory Safety** - Valgrind integration for leak detection
- ✅ **Performance** - Execution time measurement
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of invalid input
- ✅ **Edge Cases** - Empty strings, null values, large numbers
- ✅ **Stress Testing** - Large allocations, many operations

## Usage

### Running All Tests
```bash
# Complete test suite
make test

# Or use the comprehensive runner
./tests/run_all_tests.sh
```

### Running Specific Test Categories
```bash
make test-unit          # Unit tests only
make test-integration   # Integration tests only
make test-language      # Language feature tests
make test-stdlib        # Standard library tests
make test-memory        # Memory management tests
```

### Memory Testing
```bash
make test-valgrind      # Run all tests with Valgrind
```

### Coverage Reporting
```bash
make test-coverage      # Generate HTML coverage report
```

### Quick Testing
```bash
make test-smoke         # Run representative tests from each category
```

## Success Criteria

The test suite verifies that the ZEN language implementation meets these criteria:

1. ✅ **100% Feature Coverage** - All language features work correctly
2. ✅ **Zero Memory Leaks** - Valgrind reports no memory issues
3. ✅ **All Tests Pass** - Every test in every category passes
4. ✅ **Example Programs Work** - Real ZEN programs execute correctly
5. ✅ **Performance Acceptable** - Tests complete in reasonable time
6. ✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of invalid input

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Continuous Testing
- Tests run automatically on code changes
- Git hooks can enforce test passage before commits
- Multi-swarm agents coordinate to avoid conflicts

### Development Feedback
- Immediate feedback on implementation correctness
- Specific failure messages guide debugging
- Performance metrics track optimization progress

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before release
- Memory leaks block deployment
- Coverage reports ensure complete testing

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Test Categories
