    method: Implemented simplified parameter binding - replaced complex AST copying with value-based approach
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Parameter binding simplified to prevent AST node sharing

    method: Identified root cause - AST node sharing between function scope and original AST tree. Need deeper fix in variable assignment system
    success: false
    fail: true
    why_success: ''
    why_fail: Complex double-free bug requires comprehensive AST ownership model redesign. Simplified parameter binding but deeper issues remain with AST node sharing between scopes and main tree
