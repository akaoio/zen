    why_success: 'Identified and partially fixed critical while loop issue: 1) Fixed compilation errors in visitor.c, 2) Fixed scope propagation using visitor_update_ast_scope, 3) Fixed variable assignment node reuse, 4) Root cause identified: Binary operations in loops reuse AST nodes leading to stale value evaluation. While loops now create different variable nodes each iteration but binary operation evaluation still needs to be made stateless/fresh. Fixed critical architectural issue with scope management in loops.'
