    method: 'Complete fix implemented: 1) Added scope check for user-defined functions in parser_detect_object_literal() 2) Added function definitions to scope during parsing (not just visiting) 3) Added duplicate prevention to scope_add_function_definition() to handle both parser and visitor adding the same function safely'

The parser now correctly checks both builtin functions and user-defined functions in scope before applying object literal pattern matching. Functions are added to scope during parsing to enable this check.'
