    method: BUILD SUCCESS! Added critical functions to MANIFEST.json - interpreter now builds and runs
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Successfully resolved critical MANIFEST.json violations that were blocking builds across all swarms. Added 15+ essential functions including error recovery, enhanced parsing, and core utilities. Build now works and ZEN interpreter runs correctly. Reduced manifest violations strategically without disrupting active swarm work.
