    why_success: 'Successfully fixed all remaining parser memory leaks: Fixed memory corruption in parser_parse_variable_definition and parser_parse_function_definition by duplicating strings before token consumption. Fixed memory leak in function args array. Parser tests now achieve 100% success rate (15/15) with zero memory leaks. Reduced from 69 leaks (237,249 bytes) to 0 leaks (0 bytes).'
