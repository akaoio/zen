    method: 'Applied core fix: variable lookup returns stored value directly instead of re-evaluating'
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Fixed variable system bug by preventing re-evaluation in visitor_visit_variable. Changed return visitor_visit(visitor, vdef->variable_definition_value) to return vdef->variable_definition_value directly. This prevents {object} display issue and improves performance.
