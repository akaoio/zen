    method: Comprehensive value system testing completed successfully
    success: true

    method: Integration testing revealed memory leaks in complex nested structures
    success: false
    fail: true
    why_success: ''
    why_fail: Value system validation completed with mixed results. Core functionality works but memory leaks found in complex structures requiring memory system collaboration.
