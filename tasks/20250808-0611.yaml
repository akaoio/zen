    method: Successfully implemented circular reference detection for JSON functions
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Fixed infinite AST pool expansion by implementing circular reference detection system for JSON processing. The issue was caused by recursive functions json_value_to_cjson, json_cjson_to_value, and json_stringify not checking for circular references in nested objects/arrays, leading to infinite recursion and memory pool expansion.
