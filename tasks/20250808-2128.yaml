    method: Fixed global AST pool interference, implemented missing parser_parse_new_expression
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Fixed critical parser issues - disabled conflicting global AST pool initialization/cleanup in parser_new/parser_free, implemented missing parser_parse_new_expression function. Resolved build failures. Memory leak investigation shows complex patterns requiring deeper analysis, but core parser functionality restored.
