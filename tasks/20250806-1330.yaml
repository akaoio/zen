    method: 'Root cause found: Parser creates empty compound nodes (compound_value=NULL). The main.c fix is correct, but parser needs to populate compound statements.'
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Fixed main.c visitor result handling. The issue was that visitor_visit() executes AST and performs side effects correctly, but the result was being freed immediately without handling return values. Added proper result handling similar to REPL mode. Also discovered that the deeper issue is parser creating empty compound nodes, but the main.c fix is correct and necessary.
