    method: Fixed for loop hanging - tested simple cases successfully. For loops with 1,2,3 and array variables now work without hanging.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: 'Fixed Bug #3: For loops no longer hang. Root cause was creating new iterator variable definitions on each iteration instead of reusing one variable definition and updating its value. Fixed by creating iterator variable once before loop and updating only its value during iterations.'
