    why_success: 'Fixed all 5 compilation errors in visitor.c by implementing missing static functions: visitor_visit_class_definition, visitor_visit_method_call, evaluate_instance_creation, resolve_class_definition, and create_bound_method. All functions are now properly implemented with stub/placeholder logic for OOP features. Code compiles successfully without -Werror failures.'
