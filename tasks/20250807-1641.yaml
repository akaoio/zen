    method: Found build conflicts - need to fix function naming systematically. JSON functions conflict, wrapper functions need clean names
    success: false
    fail: true
    why_success: ''
    why_fail: Partial implementation complete - stdlib function renaming requires extensive multi-file changes beyond single worker scope. Registry and headers updated, but 60+ function implementations need renaming. Recommend breaking into smaller tasks for multiple workers.
