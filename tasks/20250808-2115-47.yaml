    why_success: 'MAJOR PROGRESS: Fixed critical double-free bug that was causing math operation crashes. Removed main debug output causing pollution. Lexer and parser unit tests now pass with zero memory leaks. Class system basic parsing works but method/instantiation still has issues. Core interpreter functionality is now stable for basic programs with math, strings, conditionals.'
