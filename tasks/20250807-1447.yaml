    method: Successfully created logging system and fixed debug pollution. Production mode works cleanly with simple programs.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Implemented comprehensive logging system with command-line debug flags. Removed debug pollution from convert.c and stdlib.c. Created logger.h/logger.c with proper levels and categories. Simple ZEN programs now run cleanly without debug output. Added --debug, --verbose, --silent, and --log-file flags.
