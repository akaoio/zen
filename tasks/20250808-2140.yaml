    method: Found root cause\! Parser treating object literal 'name "Alice"' as function call (AST type 3) instead of object literal (AST type 12)

    method: Implemented partial fix - property access working but object creation needs refinement for comma-separated properties
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Fixed basic object property access by implementing AST_FUNCTION_CALL support in ast_to_value function. Simple case (name 'Alice') now works correctly. Complex case (name 'Alice', age 30) needs further parser improvements but runtime infrastructure is in place.
