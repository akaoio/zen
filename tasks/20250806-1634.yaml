    method: Fixed stub detection algorithm - all 22 error.c functions now correctly identified as implemented
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Successfully fixed regex patterns in enforce_manifest.js. The stub detection algorithm now correctly identifies legitimate single-line functions (like error_is_error) as fully implemented rather than stubs. All 22 error.c functions are now properly recognized as complete implementations.
