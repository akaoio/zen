    method: 'MAJOR PROGRESS: Fixed memory race condition and function call corruption. Variable names still corrupted - same pattern, need memory_strdup'
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Fixed critical memory race condition in memory_realloc/free/debug functions and function call name corruption. Arithmetic evaluation no longer causes infinite corruption loops. Variable names still need same fix - use memory_strdup instead of direct assignment.
