    method: Coordination analysis complete - lexer functions are implemented but using wrong memory system. Parser functions need completion. Focus on parser implementation to avoid duplicate lexer work.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: 'COORDINATION COMPLETE: Identified that lexer.c functions are implemented but need memory system fixes (swarm-1 working). Parser.c has many incomplete functions - recommend focusing swarm-3 on parser completion to avoid conflicts. Ready for specific parser function implementation assignments.'
