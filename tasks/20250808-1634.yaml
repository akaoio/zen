    method: Segfault completely fixed! Variables work in file mode but not REPL - scope assignment issue.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: 'MAJOR SUCCESS: Fixed critical segmentation fault in variable printing. Root cause was double-free of scope (parser and main both freeing same scope). Also identified secondary issue: variable values become corrupted between REPL commands due to AST being freed while scope retains pointers. Segfault completely eliminated!'
