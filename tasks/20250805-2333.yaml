    method: Found critical MANIFEST.json issue - AST functions exist but are not in manifest
    success: false
    fail: true
    why_success: ''
    why_fail: 'MANIFEST.json violation: AST functions ast_new_number, ast_new_boolean, ast_new_null, ast_new_string, ast_new_binary_op, ast_new_unary_op, ast_new_array, ast_new_object, ast_free exist in code but are NOT in MANIFEST.json. As a WORKER I cannot modify MANIFEST.json - need ARCHITECT to add these functions to manifest. Recommend architect review src/core/ast.c and add missing function signatures to MANIFEST.json'
