    why_success: 'FIXED: Critical array double wrapping bug in visitor_visit_array. Arrays now display correctly as [1, 2, 3] instead of [[1, 2, 3]]. Root cause: Arrays were being converted to Value then back to AST, causing double wrapping. REMAINING ISSUE: Array internal structure still has 1 element containing nested array instead of 3 primitive elements. For loops iterate once instead of per-element.'
