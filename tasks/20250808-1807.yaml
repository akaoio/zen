    method: 'CRITICAL MANDATE: ast_copy() function at line 841 in ast.c MUST BE REMOVED immediately. It''s unauthorized per MANIFEST.json and is THE ROOT CAUSE of all double-free crashes. Every use of ast_copy creates shared node references that get freed multiple times. This function is used in 20+ places and must be replaced with proper memory management patterns. PRIORITY: Remove function and fix all call sites with proper ownership transfer or reference counting.'
