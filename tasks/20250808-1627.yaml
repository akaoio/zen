    method: Fixed visitor_execute_user_function memory leak. Parameter bindings now properly managed by scope. No more double-free errors. Remaining leaks are in lexer/parser (separate issue).
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Successfully fixed double-free memory bug in visitor_execute_user_function. Parameter bindings now properly managed by function scope to prevent double-free errors. Functions with variable assignments work correctly. Remaining lexer/parser memory leaks are separate issues for other swarms to address.
