    method: Analyzing while loop implementation in visitor.c

    fail: false
    why_success: In progress - examining current implementation
    why_fail: Not completed yet

    method: Confirmed infinite while loop bug - variable assignment not updating properly during iteration
    success: false
    fail: false
    why_success: Found the bug - set i i + 1 evaluates correctly but assignment doesn't store new value
    why_fail: Need to fix the assignment mechanism

    method: Partial fix applied - defensive copies fixed variable lookup but assignment still has issues
    success: false
    fail: false
    why_success: Variable lookup now correctly returns current value from scope
    why_fail: Still infinite loop - assignment i + 1 not evaluating correctly, need to debug further

    method: Enhanced fix - added fresh node creation but still infinite loop
    success: false
    fail: false 
    why_success: Now creating fresh AST nodes to prevent reuse
    why_fail: Binary operation i + 1 only evaluated once - AST reuse in while loop body
