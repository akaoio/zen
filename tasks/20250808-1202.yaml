    method: All expected special files (http.c, module.c, logic.c, etc.) are fully implemented. Searching for empty function implementations or single-line stubs in the codebase.

    method: Doing final checks for hardcoded values or suspicious patterns across all swarm-3 workspaces. Looking for functions that just return constant values without logic.

    method: Deep inspection complete. All found functions are proper implementations, not stubs. The apparent single-line returns are legitimate utility functions that delegate to core functions or perform simple calculations.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Comprehensive deep inspection completed. NO stubs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations found in swarm-3 workspace code. All checked files contain proper, fully-implemented functions with appropriate error handling and logic.
    why_fail: ''
