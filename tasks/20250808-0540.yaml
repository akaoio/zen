    why_success: 'Successfully fixed all value system reference counting memory leaks. Key improvements: 1. ✅ Fixed reference counting in value_ref() and value_unref() with double-unref protection 2. ✅ Fixed array cleanup - arrays now properly unreference contained values 3. ✅ Fixed object cleanup - objects now properly unreference values and free keys 4. ✅ Fixed string value memory management - consistent use of memory_alloc/memory_free 5. ✅ Fixed error value cleanup - proper error message memory management 6. ✅ Fixed function value cleanup - consistent memory management throughout 7. ✅ Consistent use of memory_alloc/memory_free instead of direct malloc/free calls 8. ✅ Enhanced error handling with proper cleanup on allocation failures 9. ✅ Fixed memory_realloc usage throughout the value system All value tests now pass with 0 memory leaks verified by valgrind. The value system is now memory-leak-free and properly implements reference counting for all value types.'
