    method: 'Math and String modules completed successfully. Both use new clean naming convention (math_abs, string_length, etc). Removed duplicate wrappers from stdlib.c. Remaining: convert, io, json, array, logging, http, system, datetime, yaml modules'
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Math and String stdlib function renaming completed successfully. Both modules now use clean naming convention consistent with core/types patterns. Updated both .c and .h files with proper stdlib interface signatures (Value** args, size_t argc). Removed duplicate wrapper functions from stdlib.c. Build system now compiles without conflicts for these modules.
