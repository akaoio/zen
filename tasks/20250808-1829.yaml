    method: 'SPECIFIC FIX NEEDED: In scope_free() line 48, the ast_free() call is causing double-free because AST nodes are owned elsewhere. Solution: Either 1) Don''t free AST nodes in scope (just set to NULL), 2) Use reference counting, or 3) Change to shallow copy model without freeing AST content. The current code creates copies but still calls ast_free() which causes the bug.'
