    method: Fixed integration tests memory leaks by changing execute_code to return bool instead of AST_T*. Found additional compilation errors in module.c but focusing on memory leak fix first.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: 'MEMORY LEAK ROOT CAUSE FOUND: Integration tests were causing memory leaks by returning visitor_visit result without proper cleanup. Fixed execute_code() to return bool instead of AST_T* and updated all test assertions. Solution follows main.c pattern where visitor result should NOT be freed directly.'
