    method: 'CRITICAL: swarm-2-zen-queen owns parser.c but there is a critical bug in parser_parse_id_or_object that blocks ALL class method functionality. Root cause: Object literal detection is called inappropriately for function calls in method bodies. Fix needed: Add context awareness to prevent object literal checking in function call contexts.'
