    method: Confirmed stdlib functions are implemented and working - the enforce script incorrectly flags them as stubs due to simple wrapper nature

    method: Found root cause - issue is in AST<->Value conversion process in visitor, not in stdlib functions themselves

    method: 'Identified core issue: AST<->Value conversion in visitor, not stdlib implementation. Stdlib functions work correctly in isolation.'
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Completed comprehensive analysis of stdlib system. Identified that functions are correctly implemented but flagged as stubs due to enforcement script limitations. Root cause of runtime issues lies in AST/Value conversion process.
