    method: Function ast_pool_is_enabled() is already fully implemented at line 676, not line 596. Checking if the reported issue is outdated or if there's another issue.

    method: Found that ast_pool_is_enabled() is actually correctly implemented, but the vision script considers it a stub because it's very simple (one line return statement). Checking if this is the expected behavior.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: ast_pool_is_enabled() is correctly and completely implemented at line 676. The function returns the logical AND of g_ast_pool_manager.initialized && g_ast_pool_manager.enabled, which is the proper implementation for checking if AST memory pools are enabled. Vision script incorrectly flagged it as stub due to simplicity, but compilation and signature verification confirm it's complete.
