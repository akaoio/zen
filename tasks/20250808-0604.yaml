    why_success: 'COMPREHENSIVE BUG HUNT COMPLETED: ‚úÖ MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED: 1. Fixed division by zero - now returns mathematical infinity/NaN instead of error (operators test passing, 0 memory leaks) 2. Fixed yaml_load_file API conflict by renaming stdlib wrapper to yaml_load_file_wrapper 3. Identified visitor memory management architecture issue causing 91KB+ leaks per test in integration/language tests 4. Developed safe memory management pattern for test helpers to handle visitor ownership model üîç BUGS IDENTIFIED: 1. JSON module has duplicate function definitions (json_ref_tracker_* functions) preventing compilation 2. Integration tests have same visitor memory ownership issues as language tests 3. Visitor returns original AST nodes in some cases, creating complex ownership chains 4. Remaining small memory leaks (8-byte) in visitor control flow loops üèóÔ∏è MEMORY MANAGEMENT INSIGHTS: - Visitor sometimes returns original input AST node (creating shared ownership) - Visitor sometimes creates new AST nodes as results (independent ownership) - Mixed ownership model requires careful cleanup patterns to avoid double-free errors - Developed double-free protection pattern: only free AST if result != original üìã NEXT PRIORITIES: 1. Fix JSON duplicate function definitions to restore compilation 2. Apply visitor memory fixes to all test suites 3. Run systematic valgrind analysis 4. Search for TODO/FIXME/stub implementations across codebase'
