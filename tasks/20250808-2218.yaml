    method: Successfully fixed visitor_visit_variable_definition memory leak - Simple test now passes with 0 leaks. Integration tests reveal additional double-free issues in visitor_visit_function_call and value_to_ast.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Fixed primary AST double-free memory leak in visitor_visit_variable_definition. Valgrind shows 0 leaks for simple programs. Integration tests reveal additional issues in visitor_visit_function_call and value_to_ast that need separate investigation.
    why_fail: ''
