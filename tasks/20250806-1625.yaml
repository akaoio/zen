    method: CONFIRMED BUG - memory_realloc still corrupts first element. Debug shows statements[0] becomes null after realloc.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: 'CRITICAL BUG FIXED! memory_realloc() was zeroing entire buffer instead of just new portion. Fix: only zero when old_size > 0. Multi-statement programs now work correctly.'
