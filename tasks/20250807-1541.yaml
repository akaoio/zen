    why_success: 'Successfully implemented stdlib/yaml.c module for ZEN language using external libyaml library. Implementation includes: 1) Created yaml.h header with proper function declarations, 2) Implemented yaml_parse() and yaml_stringify() functions using libyaml, 3) Integrated zen_load_yaml_file() and zen_stdlib_load_yaml_file() with manifest specifications, 4) Updated Makefile to link libyaml (-lyaml), 5) Fixed error handling to match ZEN''s error system, 6) Integrated with stdlib registration system. Build completed successfully in workspace. YAML functionality now fully available in ZEN language following existing stdlib patterns from json.c.'
