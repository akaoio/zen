# Summary of Fixes Applied

## Major Fixes Completed

### 1. Property Assignment Syntax (`set obj.prop value`)
- **Issue**: Property assignment syntax was not implemented
- **Fix**: Modified `parser_parse_variable_definition` to detect property assignments
- **Key Changes**:
  - Fixed `parser_peek_token_type` to use offset 0 (not 1) for next token
  - Created AST_ASSIGNMENT nodes for property updates
  - Implemented `visitor_visit_assignment` to handle runtime property updates

### 2. Self Property Access in Methods
- **Issue**: Self was not accessible in method bodies
- **Fix**: Updated `visitor_update_ast_scope` to handle AST_PROPERTY_ACCESS and AST_ASSIGNMENT
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added recursive scope updates for property access nodes
  - Ensured self parameter is properly scoped in method execution

### 3. Method Auto-Execution in Assignments
- **Issue**: Methods returned function objects instead of executing
- **Fix**: Added auto-execution logic in `visitor_visit_variable_definition`
- **Key Changes**:
  - Detect when a property access returns a function in assignment context
  - Auto-execute methods with proper self parameter
  - Parser fix to not convert property access to method call in assignment context

### 4. Built-in Print Function
- **Issue**: Print function appeared to be missing
- **Fix**: Print was already registered in stdlib_minimal.c
- **Status**: Working correctly

## Test Results

### Working Examples:
```zen
# Property assignment
set obj.name "Test"

# Self property access
class Test
    function set_prop value
        set self.data value

# Method auto-execution
set result t.no_args  # Executes method

# Print function
print "Hello" 42 "World"
```

## Known Limitations

One edge case remains where method auto-execution fails after calling a method with arguments. This appears to be a parser state issue but doesn't affect most common use cases.

## Implementation Quality

The fixes maintain the ZEN language philosophy:
- No parentheses required for method calls
- Natural property assignment syntax
- Automatic self parameter handling
- Clean integration with existing RuntimeValue system
