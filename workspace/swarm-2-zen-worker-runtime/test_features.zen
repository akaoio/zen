# ZEN Language Feature Tests
# Testing all advanced features systematically

# 1. Basic variable assignment
set name "Alice"
set age 25
set active true
set data null

print "=== Basic Variables ==="
print name
print age  
print active
print data

# 2. Arithmetic expressions
set x 10
set y 5
set sum x + y
set diff x - y
set product x * y
set quotient x / y
set remainder x % y

print "=== Arithmetic ==="
print sum
print diff
print product
print quotient
print remainder

# 3. String concatenation
set greeting "Hello " + name
print "=== String Concatenation ==="
print greeting

# 4. Arrays
set numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
set fruits "apple", "banana", "cherry"

print "=== Arrays ==="
print numbers
print fruits

# 5. Objects
set person name "John", age 30, active true
set config debug true, version "1.0"

print "=== Objects ==="
print person
print config

# 6. Comparison operators
set equal x = 10
set not_equal x != y  
set greater x > y
set less y < x

print "=== Comparisons ==="
print equal
print not_equal
print greater
print less

# 7. Boolean operations
set and_result active & true
set or_result false | active

print "=== Boolean Operations ==="
print and_result
print or_result

# 8. Simple if statement
if x > y
    print "x is greater than y"

# 9. If-else statement  
if age >= 18
    print "Adult"
else
    print "Minor"

# 10. While loop
set counter 0
while counter < 3
    print counter
    set counter counter + 1

# 11. For loop with array
for num in numbers
    print num

# 12. For loop with object
for key in person
    print key
