## TASK MANAGEMENT

### Task File Creation

You MUST create a task file in `/tasks/` directory when you start working on any implementation. The task file should be named with timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM.yaml`.

### Task File Format

```yaml
agent: {{AGENT_ID}}
task: <Brief description of what you're implementing>
created: <unix timestamp>
completed: false
files:
  - <file path 1>
  - <file path 2>
steps:
  - <unix timestamp>:
      start: <unix timestamp>
      end: 0
      method: <Description of current approach>
      success: false
      fail: false
      why_success: <Reason if successful>
      why_fail: <Reason if failed>
```

### Task Workflow

1. **Before starting any implementation**:
   ```bash
   # Create task file
   TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
   UNIX_TIME=$(date +%s)
   cat > tasks/${TIMESTAMP}.yaml << EOF
agent: {{AGENT_ID}}
task: <Your task description>
created: $UNIX_TIME
completed: false
files:
  - <files you'll work on>
steps:
  - $UNIX_TIME:
      start: $UNIX_TIME
      end: 0
      method: <Your implementation approach>
      success: false
      fail: false
      why_success: In progress
      why_fail: Not completed yet
EOF
   ```

2. **When completing a task successfully**:
   ```bash
   # Update task file to mark as complete
   sed -i 's/completed: false/completed: true/' tasks/<your-task-file>.yaml
   sed -i 's/success: false/success: true/' tasks/<your-task-file>.yaml
   sed -i "s/end: 0/end: $(date +%s)/" tasks/<your-task-file>.yaml
   sed -i 's/why_success: In progress/why_success: <reason>/' tasks/<your-task-file>.yaml
   ```

3. **If task fails**:
   ```bash
   # Update task file to mark as failed
   sed -i 's/fail: false/fail: true/' tasks/<your-task-file>.yaml
   sed -i "s/end: 0/end: $(date +%s)/" tasks/<your-task-file>.yaml
   sed -i 's/why_fail: Not completed yet/why_fail: <reason>/' tasks/<your-task-file>.yaml
   ```

### Task Analysis with Vision

Your tasks will be tracked by `make vision`:
- **Active tasks**: Show with [agent-id] next to files being worked on
- **Fitness score**: Based on your success rate and completion rate
- **Swarm coordination**: Queen can see all active tasks to avoid conflicts

### Example Task Creation

When assigned "Implement lexer_scan_number function":
```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
UNIX_TIME=$(date +%s)
cat > tasks/${TIMESTAMP}.yaml << EOF
agent: {{AGENT_ID}}
task: Implement lexer_scan_number function for NUMBER tokens
created: $UNIX_TIME
completed: false
files:
  - src/core/lexer.c
  - src/include/zen/core/lexer.h
steps:
  - $UNIX_TIME:
      start: $UNIX_TIME
      end: 0
      method: Implementing number scanning with support for integers and floats
      success: false
      fail: false
      why_success: In progress
      why_fail: Not completed yet
EOF
```
