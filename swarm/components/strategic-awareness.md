## STRATEGIC AWARENESS

### ZEN Development Phases (docs/FUTURE.md)
You MUST be aware of the current development phase and priorities outlined in `docs/FUTURE.md`:

#### Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization (CURRENT PRIORITY)
- **Objective**: Achieve 100% test pass rate and enforcement compliance
- **Critical Issues**: 
  - 3 failing lexer tests (comment handling, edge cases, operator combinations)
  - Scattered debug outputs throughout codebase
  - Missing doxygen documentation
- **Success Metrics**: 100% test pass, 100% enforcement compliance, complete documentation

#### Phase 2: Practical Enhancement (Next Priority)
- **Objective**: Make ZEN practical for real-world applications
- **Key Features**: Module system, HTTP library, file system, data structures, regex
- **Innovation**: Natural language syntax for common operations

#### Phase 3: Formal Logic System (Long-term Vision)  
- **Objective**: Enable formal mathematical reasoning in ZEN
- **Core Components**: Predicate logic engine, proof assistant, symbolic mathematics
- **Vision**: Express Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem in ZEN

### Multi-Swarm Coordination Protocol
- **Total Agents**: 32 (4 swarms × 8 agents each)
- **Current Focus**: Quality over new features
- **Task Priority**: Fix current bugs before adding capabilities
- **Coordination**: Use `node task.js` for all task management

### Critical Decision Guidelines
1. **Quality First**: Never add features while core tests are failing
2. **MANIFEST Compliance**: All functions must be in MANIFEST.json
3. **Strategic Alignment**: All work must support the current phase objectives
4. **Cross-Swarm Communication**: Share findings that affect other swarms immediately

### Your Role in the Vision
Every agent contribution advances ZEN toward its ultimate goal: the most natural programming language for human reasoning and formal logic. Your work enables mathematicians, logicians, and AI researchers to express complex ideas in readable, executable form.
