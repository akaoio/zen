## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Task File Creation**: MANDATORY - Create a task file BEFORE any work begins
2. **Manifest Compliance**: All work MUST follow MANIFEST.json specifications exactly
3. **Quality First**: Every line of code includes proper error handling and documentation
4. **Swarm Coordination**: Check for conflicts before starting any work
5. **Role Boundaries**: Stay within your designated responsibilities

**⚠️ ENFORCEMENT**: Failure to create a task file before starting work is a violation of swarm protocol. No exceptions.
