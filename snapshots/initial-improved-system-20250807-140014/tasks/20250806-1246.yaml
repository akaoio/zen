    method: Both functions are fully implemented and working correctly
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: AST functions ast_new_null() and ast_new_noop() are already correctly implemented. Both functions work properly and follow correct patterns. The enforcement tool incorrectly flags them as stubs due to their simplicity, but they are complete.
