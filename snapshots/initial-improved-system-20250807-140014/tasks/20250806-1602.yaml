    why_success: 'Successfully completed all incomplete functions in memory.c: memory_free(), memory_debug_alloc(), memory_debug_realloc(), memory_debug_free(), and memory_debug_strdup(). All functions now have proper memory pool integration, limits checking, low memory callbacks, and comprehensive error handling. Build successful, tests passing, zero memory leaks detected.'
