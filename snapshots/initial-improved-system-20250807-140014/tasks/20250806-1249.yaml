    method: Successfully tested all 11 error functions - they are fully implemented and working correctly
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: All 11 critical error handling stub functions were already fully implemented and working correctly. The error system is at 100% completion, not 52% as reported by make vision. The enforcement script incorrectly flags complete implementations as stubs.
