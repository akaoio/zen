    why_success: 'ANALYSIS COMPLETE: Root cause identified - the {object} bug occurs because variables are not properly evaluating their stored values. The issue is in visitor_visit_variable where re-evaluation causes type confusion. Fix: store evaluated values directly and return them without re-evaluation. Variable system architecture understood.'
