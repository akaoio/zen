    method: SUCCESS! Scientific notation test now PASSING. Root cause was memory_realloc+strcat corruption in string concatenation.
    success: true

    why_success: FIXED scientific notation parsing bug! Issue was memory_realloc corrupting strings during concatenation. Replaced with safe string concatenation using memory_alloc+strcpy+strcat. Test now passes.
