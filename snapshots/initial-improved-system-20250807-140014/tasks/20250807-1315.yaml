    why_success: Successfully updated MANIFEST.json with precise 3-phase development roadmap from FINAL.md consensus. Added Phase 2A functions (HTTP client, module system, advanced data structures), Phase 2B functions (regex support), and Phase 3 functions (formal logic, theorem proving). Updated AST node types, token types, performance contracts, and phase documentation. The manifest now serves as the authoritative contract for all 32 agents across 4 swarms to implement against without ambiguity.
