    why_success: 'Successfully implemented critical parser stub functions: parser_parse() and parser_is_binary_operator(). Both functions now have comprehensive implementations with proper error handling, validation, and documentation. Parser completion improved from 33% to 35% and functions are no longer flagged as stubs by the enforcement system.'
