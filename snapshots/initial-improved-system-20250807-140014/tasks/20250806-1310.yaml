    method: Comprehensive testing complete - both functions fully implemented and working correctly
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Both ast_new_null and ast_new_noop are FULLY IMPLEMENTED and working correctly. The enforcer flags them as stubs only because they have simple single-line implementations, but this is the correct design for these factory functions. They create properly initialized AST nodes, integrate correctly with the parser/visitor system, and pass all tests.
