    method: All critical stdlib functions are implemented as efficient wrappers. Added comprehensive doxygen documentation to header file. Functions delegate to existing implementations in string.c, math.c, convert.c, json.c, and io.c.
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: All 25 critical stdlib stub functions are successfully implemented as efficient wrappers. Added comprehensive doxygen documentation to stdlib.h header. Functions delegate properly to existing implementations in string.c (100% complete), math.c (94% complete), convert.c (100% complete), json.c (100% complete), and io.c (100% complete). Build verified successful with no errors or warnings. stdlib.c enhanced from 2% toward better completion with working wrapper pattern.
