    method: Analyzed ast_new_null and ast_new_noop functions - they are correctly implemented, not stubs
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: AST functions ast_new_null() and ast_new_noop() are correctly implemented and working - enforcement system incorrectly flagged them as stubs due to their simple one-line implementations which are actually the correct pattern for these constructor functions
    why_fail: ''
