    why_success: 'Identified and implemented fixes for while loop infinite loop issue: 1) Added AST_ASSIGNMENT handling to visitor 2) Enhanced variable definition to update existing variables instead of creating duplicates 3) Implemented comprehensive scope sharing between while loop condition and body. Ready to test and integrate fixes.'
