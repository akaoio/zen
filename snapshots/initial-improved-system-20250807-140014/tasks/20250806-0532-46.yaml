    method: Completed enhanced value system implementation and build successfully. All memory allocation calls now use memory management system, added atomic reference counting, enhanced error handling, and new utility functions for stdlib support

    why_success: 'Successfully enhanced ZEN value system with: 1) Memory management integration using memory_alloc/memory_free/memory_strdup 2) Atomic reference counting via memory_ref_inc/memory_ref_dec 3) Enhanced error handling with value_new_error and better error Value types 4) Type conversion utilities (value_to_number_or_nan, value_is_truthy_public, value_is_comparable) 5) String conversion safety with value_to_string_safe 6) Length utility function for stdlib support 7) Updated header with new public functions 8) All builds successfully with no memory allocation inconsistencies. Enhanced value system now provides robust foundation for error system and stdlib implementations.'
