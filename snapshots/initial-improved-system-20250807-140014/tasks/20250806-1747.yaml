    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Successfully implemented zen_array_push_stdlib and zen_array_pop_stdlib functions. Both functions follow MANIFEST.json specifications exactly, implement proper stdlib calling convention with Value** args and size_t argc parameters, include comprehensive error handling, integrate seamlessly with existing array operations, and pass all tests including edge cases. Functions are ready for production use.
