    method: Multiple scope propagation approaches failed. Issue appears to be fundamental - variable assignments in loop body not persisting across iterations. Need to document root cause for architect review.

    why_fail: 'CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED BUT NOT FULLY RESOLVED: While loop variable updates in body not visible to condition in next iteration. Implemented scope propagation fix in visitor_visit_while_loop but root cause appears deeper in variable assignment mechanism. Issue persists: variable assignments work outside loops but fail inside loops. Requires architect attention for fundamental scope/assignment system review.'
