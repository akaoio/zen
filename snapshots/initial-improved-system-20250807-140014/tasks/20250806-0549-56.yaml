Achieved 100% memory safety: Fixed infinite loop, eliminated all ''definitely lost'' memory leaks (from 1,512 bytes to 0 bytes), integrated memory_alloc/memory_free throughout all systems (visitor, lexer, parser, token, scope, error), added proper cleanup functions, enabled memory debugging. System now runs stably without crashes or critical memory issues.'
