    method: 'Found root cause: extra lexer_get_next_token call consuming PLUS token before parser_eat'
    success: true
    fail: false
    why_success: Fixed arithmetic expression parsing by correcting lexer state restoration in parser_peek_for_object_literal. All binary operators (+, -, *, /, %) now work correctly with proper precedence.
