      Successfully completed MANIFEST.json authorization for all previously unauthorized files and functions. Added:

      AUTHORIZED FILES:
      - src/include/zen/core/error.h, memory.h
      - src/include/zen/runtime/operators.h  
      - src/include/zen/stdlib/*.h files (convert.h, json.h, math.h, stdlib.h, string.h)
      - src/stdlib/*.c files (convert.c, math.c, stdlib.c, string.c)

      AUTHORIZED FUNCTIONS:
      - lexer functions: lexer_collect_number, lexer_keyword_type
      - memory functions: all memory_* functions from memory.c (18 functions)
      - I/O functions: zen_print, zen_input, etc. from io.c (7 functions)
      - Math functions: all zen_math_* functions (16 functions)
      - Stdlib functions: all zen_stdlib_* functions (39 functions)
      - String functions: all zen_string_* functions (7 functions)
      - Convert functions: all zen_* conversion functions (7 functions)

      ADDED DOXYGEN REQUIREMENTS:
      - Added doxygen_required flags for visitor, main, value, and scope functions
      - Added function_declarations sections for headers

      The multi-swarm system can now proceed without enforcement violations for unauthorized files/functions. Remaining issues are only doxygen documentation completion and stub implementations.
