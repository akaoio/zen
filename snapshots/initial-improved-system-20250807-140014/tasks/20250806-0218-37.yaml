    why_success: 'FIXED: Parser now correctly handles variables in expressions. Issue was parser_parse_variable incorrectly treating ''x'' in ''x + y'' as function call instead of variable. Implemented conservative logic to treat identifiers as variables when followed by another identifier (common in binary expressions).'
