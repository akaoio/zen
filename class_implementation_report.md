# Class Implementation Status Report

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **Lexer Support**
   - TOKEN_METHOD added and recognized
   - 'method' keyword properly tokenized

2. **Parser Support**
   - Class definitions parse correctly
   - Method definitions parse correctly
   - `new` expressions parse correctly
   - Fixed infinite loop bug in method parsing

3. **Runtime Value Types**
   - RV_CLASS and RV_INSTANCE types added
   - Proper memory management for class/instance types
   - String representation for classes and instances

4. **Visitor Support**
   - Classes are created and stored in scope
   - Instances can be created with `new`
   - Class metadata properly stored

## üêõ Known Issues

### Critical Bugs

1. **Method Calls Cause Segfault**
   - Calling methods on instances crashes the interpreter
   - Example: `calc.add 5 3` causes segmentation fault
   - Root cause: Method resolution and execution not fully implemented

2. **Missing Method Resolution**
   - No visitor_execute_method function
   - Property access on instances doesn't handle method calls
   - AST_METHOD_CALL node type not implemented

3. **'this' Binding Not Implemented**
   - Methods don't have access to instance context
   - No mechanism to bind 'this' in method scope

## üìä Test Results

### Working:
```zen
# Class definition
class Calculator
    method add a b
        return a + b

# Instance creation
set calc new Calculator
print calc  # Output: {__class__: {...}}
```

### Not Working:
```zen
# Method calls
set result calc.add 5 3  # SEGFAULT

# Constructor
class Person
    method constructor name
        set this.name name

set p new Person "Alice"  # Constructor not called
```

## üîß Required Fixes

1. **Implement Method Call Resolution**
   - Update property access visitor to handle method calls
   - Create proper method execution with 'this' binding
   - Handle method arguments correctly

2. **Fix Constructor Execution**
   - Constructors should be called during instantiation
   - 'this' should be bound to the new instance

3. **Add Inheritance Support**
   - `extends` keyword parsed but not implemented
   - Parent class methods not inherited

## üìù Recommendations

The class system has a solid foundation but needs critical fixes before it's usable:

1. **Priority 1**: Fix method call crashes
2. **Priority 2**: Implement 'this' binding
3. **Priority 3**: Fix constructor execution
4. **Priority 4**: Add inheritance support

The implementation is about 60% complete - structure is there but execution is broken.
