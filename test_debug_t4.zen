# What Test 4 expects:
# Input: user name "Charlie", id 123, settings theme "dark", notifications true
# Expected: {user: {name: "Charlie", id: 123}, settings: {theme: "dark", notifications: true}}

# But the way it's written, it seems like it's trying to nest everything
# Let me test what was expected
set data1 user name "Charlie", id 123
print "data1:"
print data1

set data2 settings theme "dark", notifications true  
print "data2:"
print data2
