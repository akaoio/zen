# ZEN Class Implementation Stress Test Report

## Summary

The ZEN class implementation has been tested with various edge cases, panic scenarios, and stress tests. Here are the findings:

## ✅ Working Features

1. **Basic Class Definition**
   - Empty classes work
   - Classes with methods work
   - Multiple class definitions in sequence work

2. **Instance Creation**
   - `new ClassName` syntax works
   - Creates instance objects successfully
   - Handles "new" as a special function

3. **Error Handling**
   - Properly errors when class doesn't exist
   - Handles `new` without arguments
   - Handles `new` with non-variable arguments

## ❌ Issues Found

### 1. Memory Leaks
- **Severity**: High
- **Details**: Valgrind reports 1,924 bytes definitely lost in 10 blocks
- **Cause**: AST nodes created during parsing are not properly freed
- **Impact**: Long-running programs will consume increasing memory

### 2. Method Calls Not Implemented
- **Severity**: High  
- **Details**: `instance.method()` syntax not implemented
- **Impact**: Classes can be created but methods cannot be called

### 3. Property Access Not Implemented
- **Severity**: High
- **Details**: `this.property` syntax not implemented
- **Impact**: Cannot store or access instance data

### 4. Constructor Not Implemented
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Details**: Constructor methods are parsed but not executed
- **Impact**: Cannot initialize instances with data

### 5. Inheritance Not Implemented
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Details**: `extends` keyword parsed but inheritance not functional
- **Impact**: No code reuse through inheritance

### 6. Stability Issues
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Details**: Some test combinations cause hangs or crashes
- **Impact**: Not production-ready

## Test Results

### Panic Tests
```zen
# These cause issues:
- set x 1 + new ClassName  # Hangs
- class new                # Creates class named "new" 
- Multiple classes with methods # Sometimes hangs
```

### Memory Test
```zen
# Creating 100 instances shows memory leaks
for i in 1..100
    set var new ClassName
```

### Edge Cases
```zen
# These work:
class Empty              # ✓
class _UnderscoreStart   # ✓ 
class Class123           # ✓
new NonExistent          # ✓ (proper error)

# These don't work:
instance.method()        # ✗
this.property = value    # ✗
super.method()           # ✗
```

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Memory Leaks** - Critical for production use
2. **Implement Method Calls** - Essential for OOP
3. **Implement Property Access** - Required for instance state
4. **Add Constructor Support** - Needed for initialization
5. **Complete Inheritance** - For code reuse
6. **Improve Error Messages** - Better debugging experience
7. **Add More Tests** - Ensure stability

## Conclusion

The class implementation provides a solid foundation with working class definitions and instance creation. However, it lacks essential OOP features like method calls, property access, and proper memory management. The implementation is approximately 30% complete and requires significant work before production use.

### Risk Assessment
- **Development Use**: ⚠️ Proceed with caution
- **Production Use**: ❌ Not recommended
- **Memory Safety**: ❌ Has leaks
- **Feature Complete**: 30%
- **Stability**: 60%
